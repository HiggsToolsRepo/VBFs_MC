\section{Introduction \todo{all}} 
With the second run of LHC in progress, the main goal the community have is to
better measure, and describe, the features characterising the so much Standard-Model
look alike Higgs boson. In order to achieve this goal, we need to increase our power
to discriminate between what we define as the {\it signal} and what then is the {\it background}, the former being the part of sample which has the features we would like to measure while the latter is usually something we would like to get rid of.
As it is very well known, the main production mode of a Higgs boson at
hadron colliders is gluon fusion, with the Higgs boson further decaying into two photons.
Although this channel is the one that provided with the discovery of this particle 
(and some of its properties),
