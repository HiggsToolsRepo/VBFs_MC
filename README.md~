In git every repository is a full copy. Then there is the github copy,
which is the one we share.

The basic workflow to work in your *own* repository is:

1) Select the files you are going to commit:

git add <file1> <file2> ...

To add everything:

git add .

You can ignore some changes when running this command by adding the corresponfing filenames to a .gitignore file (also works for folders and extensions ie '*.aux', see examples online).

2) When you have everything added do:

git commit

and write a DESCRIPTIVE message of what have you done. This is useful
for your collaborators as well as your future self.

You can look at what your repository looks like with

git status

however a much nicer way is to add the following to your .bashrc


export GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1
export GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES=true
export PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[01;34m\] \w\[\033[00;33m\]$(__git_ps1)\[\033[01;34m\] \$\[\033[00m\] '


The last line is linuxmint-specific (because of the colors). Search git ps1 <yout os> for a
better alternative.

Yu can see the past commits with

git log

Adding experimental features

When changing thinks that can possibly break something, it is better
to use branches.

you do something like

git checkout -b <mynewexperimentalfeature>

This creates a new branch and points you to it. You can switch to
another branch, with git checkout <branch> (without the -b). 

The default branch is called "master".

In your new branch,  add your commits as above. Once it is stabilized
and working, you can merge back in the main code with:

git checkout master
git merge <mynewexperimentalfeature>

---------------------------------------------------------------------


Sharing your commits (DO READ THIS)
----------------------------------

First make sure you don't have uncommited changes.

Then download the commits that you don't have:

git pull

At this point you should pray that there are no conflicts (not discussed here). 

Then push your existing changes to the github server:

git push
